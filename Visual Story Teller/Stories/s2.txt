\f0\fs24 \cf0 Once upon a time there was a girl who, though of humble origin, was so incredibly beautiful that she was famed throughout the region. Knowing how much the young men of the Kingdom liked her, she rejected all her suitors, waiting for the arrival of some handsome Prince. Well, it didn\'92t take long for a handsome Prince to come by, and as soon as he saw the young girl he fell for her and showered her with compliments and gifts. The wedding was extravagant, and everyone said they made the perfect couple.\
However, when the shine and excitement of the presents and the parties began to wear off, the young Princess found out that her handsome young husband wasn\'92t as wonderful as she had expected. He behaved like a tyrant towards his people, he boasted about his wife as though she was a hunting trophy, and he was selfish and mean. When she came to see that everything about her husband was a false appearance, she didn\'92t hesitate to tell him this to his face, but he answered her back in a similar vein, reminding her that he had only chosen her for her beauty, and that she could have chosen many others rather than himself, if she hadn\'92t let herself be carried away by ambition and her desire to live in a palace.\
The Princess cried for days, seeing the truth in her husband\'92s cruel words. She remembered all the many good and honest young men she\'92d rejected only so she could become a Princess. Wanting to undo her mistake, the Princess tried to leave the palace, but the Prince wouldn\'92t allow her, since everyone talked about the extraordinary beauty of his wife, and this added to the Prince\'92s reputation as an exceptional man. The Princess made so many attempts to escape that she ended up locked away, constantly watched by guards.}
